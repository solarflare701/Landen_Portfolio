### About Me 

Hello! I am a current student and para-professional with over 2 years of proven expertise in psychology and clinical counseling.

With skills in critical thinking, data management using Excel, assessing psychological disorders, writing, and programming in Python, I am able to identify a wide variety of disorders within the DSM-5, and achieve a more satisfied state of living amongst clients. I am adept at using Excel, Python, ScreenPal, and SPSS. 

My robust skill set, commitment to integrity, and passion for counseling make me a valuable asset. In my spare time, I like to write fictional stories and play baseball.
