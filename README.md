### Projects

#### Personality Test

**Initial project idea 1:** 
How did you come up with this project? What problem did you set out to solve, and why was it a problem that needed to be solved?

With the personality test project I set out to better my understanding of others through a theme I am familiar with. It goes without saying that we are all capable of being elaborate beings with complex thoughts and emotions and reaching a common ground to meet those differences alongside what makes us similar can help bridge the gap between us.

Tools I used: 
What tools did you use in completing this project?

I used the Python coding language on JDoodle to accomplish this goal. I also made use of the character biographies of those I used to act as the themes of the different personalities.

Challenges I faced:
What challenges did you face, and how? What obstacles did you overcome? 

The biggest challenge I faced with this project was setting up the scoring portion of the personality test. After some initial test runs, I found it to be almost impossible to naturally score into a couple of the personality types. After reassessing the point values for the answers on the test, I was able to reorient them to make each personality plausible to achieve.

Other Resources: 
Did you use any other resources? Did you collaborate with anyone to get this done?

There were no other resources that I used in this endeavor and I did not collaborate with anyone in the production of this project.

Result:
What did you set out to achieve? Did you achieve it? What improvements would you like to make if you had a chance to take this further?
I had set out to create a personality test that can sort peopleâ€™s personalities by applying a character to them that I am familiar with and I was successful in this goal. The primary improvement I would make to this project if I were to take this further would be to add many more questions to the test to ensure that the test results end up being even more accurate.
